answer: Gender {Trouble}

This work describes the "locus of intractibility" over a central word in a section on "the circular ruins of contemporary debate." This work draws from Freud that birth is a "cathexis of instinctual drives" while it cites Joan Riviere's idea that aggression is transformed into flirtation by "masquerade." Foucault's The History of Sexuality hsis dismissed as romantic in the discussion of Herculine Barbin, while Foucault himself is dismissed as a repressed homosexual. This work ends with a conclusion "from parody to politics" and Monique Wittig is discussed on lesbianism in the third chapter, "Subversive Bodily Acts." Claiming a "heterosexual matrix" is "produced", it also contends its central concept is "constructed" and introduces notions of gender performativity. For 10 points, name this seminal work by the incomprehensible Judith Butler.

This figure's most famous lover was conceived when an almond was placed in the bosom of his mother, Nana. That lover went crazy and castrated himself when this deity showed up at his wedding out of jealousy.

answer: On the {Genealogy} of {Morals} or On the {Genealogy} of {Morality} [accept: {Zur Genealogie der Moral}]

One section of this book warns that “we find ourselves face to face with the representative of seriousness itself” and defines “physician” as one who treats the cause of suffering, rather than suffering itself. This book opens by mocking “English psychologists” and includes sections on etymology, focusing largely on words for white and black. The final part of this book deals with asceticism, while the earlier parts trace the titular concept to ressentiment and Jewish priests.

answer: {Perun}

Procopius incorrectly stated that this deity was the only god worshipped by the pagan Slavs, while in the Golden Bough James Frazer states that in Novgorod an eternal flame was dedicated to this god, and that if it ever went out the attendants were executed for negligence.

In pre-Christian Poland this god's symbol was drawn on the roof of houses to protect them from his wrath. This god slew the dragon Veles, perhaps with his magical axe, which always returned to his hand when he threw it and is similar to Thor's Hammer. The son of the fire god Svarog, for ten points, name this thunder god from Slavic mythology.

One figure was killed during this event because of his vow to never attack a woman, and a failed attempt to avoid this event was made by a diplomat who stayed at the house of the minister Vidura. This event was sparked when a group that had been exiled for thirteen years due to a dice game was denied their restoration by Duryodhana.

answer: {History} and {Class} Consciousness

This work argues that Kant believed his method was capable of "limitless expansion" while claiming that the "behaviour of industry" and the "dialectical relation between subject and object" is ignored in Engels' Anti-Duhring. Its first section decries the "vulgar materialism" which men such as Eduard Berstein have tried to disguise. This work contends that insoluble antinomies were the only thing classical philosophy could give to the bourgeois, and this work's central section consists of the essay "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat." Ending with an essay "Towards a Methodology of the Problem of Organization",  it attributes an "overestimation of the spontaneous, elemental forces of the Revolution" to Rosa Luxemburg and  Contending all classes but the proletariats are trapped in a "false consciousness", for 10 points, name this work of Gyorgy Lukacs.

One character in this text recommends cutting the ground in the shape of an inverted gamma. In a chapter of The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault explored the ideology of power inherent in this text's introduction of Ischomachus as a figure skilled in the art of training his wife to perform household chores. The main speaker of this work claims that he is wealthy because his modest property meets all of his needs, and that those with cows are wealthier than those with money. The opening line of this work sees Critobulus affirm that the titular concept is, like medicine or carpentry, the name of a particular kind of knowledge or science.

answer: {John J. Mearsheimer}

This thinker rejected the idea that total disarmament would lead to world peace by saying “for every neck there are two hands to choke it”. This man's criticism of Offense-Defense Balance theory is that one cannot ex ante tell if a weapon's best use is for defense or offense.

answer: An {Attempt} at a {Critique} of All {Revelation}

Early in this work, the author distinguishes between Gluck and Gluckseligheit, though he concludes that neither can be universally valid as both rest on solely empirical principles. That discussion serves to explain the various characterizations of the “sensuous impulse” and deduces that moral law cannot contradict itself by abrogating the justifications of that impulse. In a section titled, “Deduction of Religion in General,” the author requires that God produce a “complete congruency” between the moral law and the happiness of finite rational beings, asserting he must be “totally just.” This work shows that a test of congruency does not hold for the doctrine of Original Sin, but it does not explicitly target Christianity. First mistaken for a work of Kant, for ten points name broad criticism of religion by Johann Fichte.
