answer: {natural} numbers [or naturals; accept {N} before the end; prompt on {integers;} accept {positive integers}

This set, a commutative monoid, is the domain of Landau's function as well as of the totient (TOH-shent) function, and numbers of this type can be written as the sum of other numbers of this type via a partition. According to the well-ordering principle, any subset of this set contains a least element. Multiplication and addition on this set are recursively defined along with a successor function by the Peano axioms. According to the Archimedean property, there exists one of these numbers larger than any given real number; and all inductive sets contain these numbers as a subset. Contained in both the rationals and the integers, name this set of the positive integers, denoted N.

answer: {hydrofluoric} acid [accept {HF} before the end; accept aqueous {hydrogen fluoride}]

Like sulfuric acid, this substance is used as a catalyst in the alkylation of isobutane. When used with antimony trifluoride to treat chloroform, Teflon is created. This chemical is prepared by reacting its anion's namesake mineral with sulfuric acid, or as a byproduct in the creation of phosphoric acid. It does not completely dissociate in water, so it penetrates skin very easily, reacting with calcium to dissolve bone. Because of the very low entropy of hydration for its anion, despite being incredibly corrosive, it is a weak acid; that high strength comes from the strongest-known bond with hydrogen. Stored in Teflon containers, name this haloacid used to etch glass, with formula HF.
