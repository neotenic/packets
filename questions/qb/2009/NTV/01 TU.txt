answer: Euclid of Alexandria [or {Eukleíd?s}]

This man's namesake orchard consists of one-dimensional trees planted at lattice points in the plane. His namesake metric is the L-P metric with p equaling two, which is also the “usual” metric. His namesake algorithm subtracts integer multiples of one given number from another to compute the two numbers' greatest common factor. He also names geometries that assume that given a line and a point not on it, there is exactly one line that does not intersect the given line. His most famous work started from five axioms and five postulates. Name this mathematician who created the parallel postulate in his treatise on geometry, The Elements—an ancient Greek.

answer: {Ampère's} Circuit Law [or the {Ampère}-{Maxwell} Law]

In combination with the London equation, this law can be used to find the penetration depth in the Meissner effect. Its original form implied that the magnetic field was solenoidal. It can also be expressed as “the curl of the H-field equals the conduction current”, and for static fields, this law is equivalent to the Biot-Savart law. Its original form was incompatible with capacitors, so Maxwell added a term of the time-derivative of the E-field, the displacement current, to this equation. This law states that the free current is proportional to the path integral of magnetic field with respect to displacement. Used to find the magnetic field produced by a wire, name this one of Maxwell's equations, named for a French physicist.
