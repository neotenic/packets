answer: attack on the USS {Cole} [accept clear knowledge equivalents, including more specific answers like

This event resulted in an investigation that was hampered by friction between Barbara Bodine and John O'Neill, and a president deciding not to act because he was tired of swatting at flies. Some people blamed Kirk Lippold, who had planned on making a refueling stop. While one of its perpetrators, who had previously been involved in arranging false passports and smuggling missiles, admitted to this attack, the admission was made under torture, so the charges against him have temporarily been dropped. Seventeen Americans were killed, and many of the perpetrators either escaped from or were released from Yemen prisons.

answer: {auxins}

Produced from tryptophan, parenchyma cells are responsible for this compound's polar transport through coleoptile tissue. It activates expansins which loosen cellulose microfibrils, in turn causing the target cell to take in water, according to the acid growth hypothesis. At high concentrations, it stimulates ethylene production, and as dicots are more sensitive to synthetic ones, it is often used as an herbicide. Responsible for vascular cambium growth and many tropisms, it is produced in meristem tissue. Name this class of chemicals explained by Frits Went, responsible for cell elongation in plants—the first plant hormone to be discovered.

This measure also nullified the three-fifths clause, though it excepted “Indians not taxed”, and established twenty-one as the voting age. This amendment stated that anyone born in the United States is a citizen, and established equal protection and due process. Name this second of the Reconstruction amendments.

answer: {supersaturated solutions} [accept {supersaturation}, etc.]

These substances comprise the bottom layer of solar ponds, and they can exist because condensation cannot take place without surface energy. An example of them is clouds, forming from atmospheric air that is this type of substance. These substances are present in cloud chambers, and can be disturbed by the introduction of nucleation sites, such as by the addition of a “seed crystal”. Name this phenomenon, normally created by heating, in which a solvent dissolves more of a substance than it can hold in stable solution.

These entities can undergo gas accretion caused by Roche lobe overflow; in 2004, it was discovered that these led to the 1572 supernova studied by Tycho Brahe. Pinwheel nebulae can form around these objects, and the discovery of one of these systems, consisting of pulsars, won the 1993 Nobel in Physics for Hulse and Taylor.

This effect is present in animal bones, possibly to regulate growth. It is analogous to the cause of hum in transformers, magnetostriction, while in medical imaging, the most common material used for this effect is lead zirconate titanate. Carbon nanotubes also respond to this effect, for which an especially high quality factor is possessed by quartz. This phenomenon's converse consists of an applied field causing a crystal's dimensions to change. Discovered by the Curie brothers, identify this effect wherein stress applied to a crystal creates an electric potential difference.
