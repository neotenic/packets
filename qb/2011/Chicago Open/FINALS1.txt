answer: The Book of {Martyrs} (accept the "{Actes} and {Monuments}" until {that's} mentioned)

The final chapter of this book begins with a story of how Samuel Mills arranged a meeting in a haystack, and how his students, including Doctor Adoniram Judson, sailed from Massachusetts to Calcutta - that chapter is entitled "The Beginnings of American Foreign Missions." The author of this work was patronized by Mary Fitzroy, the duchess of Richmond, and was the tutor to her nephews. This book was published by the printer John Day, a close friend of the author, and William Cecil sponsored a measure to include it in every cathedral. Its twenty-four chapters include a life of William Tyndale, and its original title called it the "Acts and Monuments of these Latter and Perilous Days, Touching Matters of the Church." Containing tales about the Lollards and the Marian persecutions, FTP, name this work by John Foxe, a gigantic work of the Protestant Reformation which focuses on lots of holy people dying.

answer: {Rubyfruit Jungle}

A minor character in this novel is tricked into eating rabbit droppings that are put into his Sunmaid raisin box. Another character is the author of the study The Creative Spirit of the Middle Ages and shows off a copy of Hroswitha's "Dulcitus" at her house. The main character notices that her classmate "Broccoli" Detwiler has an uncircumcised penis, so she decides they can make money by showing it off to kids for a nickel a peak. She revisits her hometown of Coffee Hollow, Pennsylvania after being expelled from the University of Florida, and reminisces on Carolyn Simpson, the head cheerleader at Lauderdale High, as well as her redneck friend Leroy Denman. In the end, the documentary film created by Molly Bolt is ignored and most of her lesbian lovers deny their feelings for her. This novel is titled for the slang term she uses for her genitals, because she thinks they're simply delicious. FTP, name this 1973 picaresque masterpiece by Rita Mae Brown.

answer: {Amides} [do not accept or prompt on "{amine}" do not accept "{lactams}," because only a few of the clues could refer to them]

Bis-these can be derived in a four component reaction that involves a double attack on an imino carbon. Schotten-Baumann conditions describe slowly adding stoichiometric base in one reaction creating these compounds from acid chlorides. These compounds can be arylated with palladium or copper catalyst, such as in the Goldberg reaction, while acid catalyzed rearrangements of oximes can result in these compounds.  In addition to reactions named for Ugi and Beckmann, one of these compounds is ionized in the first step of a reaction that proceeds via halogenation and results in an amine with one fewer carbon. Simple hydrolysis of these compounds results in the formation of an amine and a carboxylic acid, as in peptide linkages. FTP, name this class of molecules in which a carbon atom is double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to a nitrogen atom.

answer: {Pinckney}

One woman with this last name, Frances, was the first wife of Robert Hayne. Another woman with the maiden name Eliza Lucas took this last name upon marriage - she gained fame as the first person to successfully cultivate indigo in the American colonies, at the Belmont Plantation. One man by this surname joined his fellow state Senator Pierce Butler in introducing the Fugitive Slave Clause to the Constitution. A quote by Robert Goodloe Harper was infamously misattributed to another man of this family, who probably said "not a sixpence!" rather than "millions for tribute, but not one cent for peace!" as he's often quoted. Another man of this name negotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo along with Manuel de Godoy, which established the US boundary with Spanish Florida - that treaty is more often called by this man's name. FTP, name this South Carolina family of patriots which included "Charles" and "Charles Cotesworth."

answer: King {Gesar}

During one episode, he attempts to lasso a deer, but the deer ensnares him in his own lasso by dancing around him - this figure is only saved from choking when the deer is smacked with a stone. After coming out of his mother's womb, he manages to kill a flock of metal birds with a makeshift bow and arrow he'd just fashioned, just as a bird is about to spear him. He transforms himself into a gold fish and gets swallowed, so he can then transform into a wheel and defeat his opponent from inside his stomach. That opponent had a magic parrot, magpie, and crow who were sent out to obtain wives - leading to the kidnapping of this man's wife Zholmo. He also defeated a king who dined on children after that king kidnapped Maisa, though Maisa later duped him with a potion, leading his kingdom to be invaded by the state of Hor. FTP, name this great hero who vanquishes demons for his kingdom of Ling, and is the subject of a super long epic poem from Tibet.

answer: Ernest {Gellner}

This thinker wrote about the role of the "Igurramen" or priestly class who maintain order in the "Outer Circle" of Moroccan society, after conducting fieldwork amongst Berber tribes, leading to his only work of ethnology The Saints of the Atlas. He returned to Morocco with his monograph on Ibn Khaldun collected in his book Muslim Society. He argued that three spheres of human activity which he dubbed cognition, coercion, and production were in an unusual and favorable condition prior to birth of industrial society - those processes are symbolized by the title ideas in his work Plough, Sword, and Book. Another work contains a foreword by Bertrand Russell and was notably hated by Gilbert Ryle, who refused to review it in Mind, because of its "critical account of linguistic philosophy." This author of Words and Things wrote his most famous book about the drive for modern society to have congruent cultural units, so as to enhance the ability to communicate. FTP, name this British philosopher who wrote Nations and Nationalism.

answer: {Atala}

One character in this book admonishes that, even after thirty years of exile in the mountains, you will find that "you do not know anything, you are nothing, and there is no punishment so terrible...that the corrupted flesh cannot tolerate it." After a bolt of lightning splits a tree in two, the main characters meet that man, the hermit Father Aubry, and his trusty dog. It's earlier revealed that the primary female is not the daughter of Simaghan, and instead her father is the elderly Lopez. Her companion is freed as he's about to be burnt at the stake during the Feast of the Dead. A painting of the burial scene in this book was created by Anne-Louis Girodet. The frame story of the book sees Chactas, the patriarch of the Natchez tribe, relate his adventure to René, who became the title character of the author's subsequent book. Subtitled as the "Loves of Two Savages in the Desert," FTP, name this Romantic novella by the French writer Chateaubriand, titled for its central character, an Indian maiden.

answer: {Carol} I of Romania (or {Karl} I, or {Prince Karl} of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen)

This ruler ascended to the throne when the so-called "Monstrous Coalition" of liberals and conservatives formed to overthrow Alexander Cuza and nominated him as ruler. He adopted his nephew as heir, but since the constitution required a foreign bride, that nephew was wed to Marie of Edinburgh. This ruler hired the architect Wilhelm Doderer to construct the Peles Castle, which served as his summer residence. His queen used the pseudonym "Dito et Idem" to write literary works like the poem "Sweet Hours," but that queen Elisabeth of Wied is better known for using the pen name "Carmen Sylva." This man's death at Sinaia led to his succession by his nephew King Ferdinand I. This ruler established the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Dynasty when he became the first official king of his nation, after it became independent by the Treaty of Berlin in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War in 1881. FTP, name this long-reigning first king of Romania.

answer: {Proteasome}

Salinosporamide A is a potent inhibitor of this complex, and Gankyrin is a component of one of its subunits. Another inhibitor of this complex is used to treat relapses of multiple myeloma and causes peripheral neuropathy; that drug is bortezomib. An 11S regulatory particle attaches to this structure when it is used to generate antigens for presentation on MHC complexes. Ciechanover, Hershko, and Rose won the 2004 Nobel for characterizing this complex. Its most common form has a 20S core particle and two 19S caps, and its structure is very similar to that of chaperonins. This protein complex has catalytic subunits with trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and PHGH-like activities, and proteins are unfolded within its central barrel in an ATP-independent fashion. Proteins are targeted here after being ubiquitinated repeatedly. FTP, name this protein complex responsible for degrading a variety of other proteins into small peptides.

One work by this artist was originally titled "They Work, They Eat, and They Go Home" - that triptych shows laborers working on a building at morning, noon, and evening respectively. He showed two large black doors of a brick building with graffiti scrawled on them in his canvas Bankruptcy. His foray into fashion saw him design an "Anti-Neutral Suit" which was meant to encourage men to join the war effort. The top of his best known canvas seems to show a woman with fifteen feet, some of which are solid and some transparent, while another canvas shows the "hand of a violinist." He named his two daughters Propellor and Light, fitting since another popular canvas of his shows a radiating streetlight. FTP, name this artist who painted Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, and helped found the Futurist movement.

An article titled after this objective argues for it by inventing the word "teavy" and posing the question "is this table teavy?." That article defends this position by claiming that "the expression of attitude" is best achieved by art and poetry, but not by confusing the domain of science with artistic expression - an error which Nietzsche avoids. The author argues that this is necessary by stating that there are two kinds of pseudo-statements - ones which contain a word erroneously believed to have meaning, and ones where constituent words are meaningful but put together in a "counter-syntactical way." Another book's first chapter is titled after this - that chapter considers the similar phrases "Martyrs suffer" and "Martyrs exist," and contrasts them with the phrases "dogs are faithful" and "unicorns are fictitious." The aforementioned article by Rudolf Carnap argues for this "Through Logical Analysis of Language", while the verification principle is used to argue for this in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic. FTP, name this common objective which seeks to do away with a certain branch of philosophy.

answer: {Stability} [accept {Lyapunov Stability} before mention]

Barbalat's lemma is useful when analyzing this property in time-varying systems. Lienard's theorem gives the conditions needed to guarantee the van der Pol oscillator possesses this property. The second method of one of this property's namesakes requires a function V of x such that V of x is greater than zero and V-dot of x is less than zero. Barkhausen names a criteria for this property in which the product of the gain and the transfer function is one, graphically illustrated in a Bode plot. Electrical engineers usually consider the BIBO form of this property in linear signals, while this property of equilibria is asymptotic if solutions converge to that equilibria, but merely Lyapunov if solutions do not escape. FTP, name this property that chaotic systems lack in which a small error in input results in a small error in output.

In one work, this man writes "it is not the quality of goods and utility which matter, but movement; not where you are or what you have, but what you have come from, where you are going and the rate at which you are getting there." A letter to his second wife, Constance Webb, was attached to the back of his essay "Dialectical Materialism and the Fate of Humanity." A novel by him centers on love affairs between Nurse Jackson, the landlady Mrs. Rouse, and her pretty niece Maisie, who deserts the protagonist Haynes by shipping off to America. This man joined Raya Dunayevskaya and Grace Lee Boggs in founding the Johnson-Forest Tendency, a Trotskyist group partly named for his pseudonym. He also wrote a study of Moby Dick - Mariners, Renegades, and Castaway - and he adapted a Kipling quote by asking "what do they know of cricket who only cricket know?" in his book Beyond a Boundary.

One of this man's most important public acts allowed foreigners to enter any trade except for barber and wigmaker - he did so by disbanding the guilds, or jurandes, and paying off the men who controlled them. He wrote a handbook for his two Chinese students entitled Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Riches. Before ascending to political power, he gave an oration entitled "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind," which argued that Christian ideals allowed for universal human progress.

Bicuspid aortic valves are associated with a mutation in one of these proteins, while mutation in a protein protein that activates one of these proteins results in a condition in which there is a paucity of bile ducts, known as Allagile syndrome. Familial hemiplegic migraine is caused by a mutation in the third of these proteins. Another mutation in these causes the most common hereditary stroke disorder, known as CADASIL syndrome. Their extracellular EGF-like repeats are variably glycosylated by Lunatic Fringe, Radical Fringe, and Manic Fringe, which alters their signaling properties.  These proteins activate the CSL transcription factor. Like TNF-alpha, one domain of these proteins is cleaved by ADAMTS17, while their intracellular domains are cleaved by gamma-secretase. These proteins are homologs of a drosophila protein that binds to delta and serrate ligands, while in humans they bind to JAG proteins. FTP, name these proteins, who get their name from their drosophila homolog whose mutation caused indentations to appear on the wings.

answer: {Chamorro} (or indigenous peoples of {Guam} is also acceptable)

According to legend, these indigenous peoples lost their status as a pure race when their chief sent two four-year old boys on a mission - those boys dropped the "Camel Rock" that they were carrying when they were fooled by a twinkling star - and, as a result, that rock was no longer able to stop foreigners from invading the lands of these people. That legend is written on the "Star Cave" pictographs of these peoples in the Ritidian cavern. Their pre-historic culture consisted of three classes - the matua, the atchoat, and the mangatchang or lower classes. They were historically susceptible to Lytico-bodig disease, a fact written about by Oliver Sacks in his book The Island of the Colorblind. The dwellings of these people, like those around the Fena Lake region, were built upon the so-called "Latte stones" which are often cited as symbols of their early culture. The "Lost Pond" village of these peoples is centered around the modern-day area of Hagatna, or Agaña. FTP, name these indigenous residents of a certain Pacific island in the Marianas which is now a U.S. territory.
