answer: {complete} [accept {NP}-{complete} before {BPP}]

The Berman-Hartmanis conjecture states that for one certain class, all sets with this property are pairwise P-isomorphic. BPP has no known languages with this property. A tree of this type has all leaves on the last or second to last level, and all on the left. For a complexity class, if a problem is both that class hard and in that class, that problem can be described as having this property. In graph theory, a graph has this property if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. For 10 points, give this word that when talking about decision problems such as knapsack and traveling salesman is added to the end of NP.

answer: amylase

Gibberellins are thought to induce germination by forcing the secretion of this enzyme by aleurone cells. The potency of a preparation of this enzyme may be measured in degrees Lintner. One form of this enzyme is inhibited by a compound isolated from white beans called phaseolamin. This enzyme's gamma form will act on alpha-1,6 bonds and favors acidic environments. Another form of this enzyme successively produces maltose units and functions in ripening; that form is the beta form. This enzyme breaks alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds and is quickly inhibited by gastric acid. For 10 points, name this group of enzymes that break down starch into sugar, whose best known form is the "salivary" form.
