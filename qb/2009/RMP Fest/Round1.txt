An early example of the concept comes from the work of W?adys?aw Tatarkiewicz, who discussed it with reference to dominoes. Later, Vygotsky contributed to its conceptual elaboration by noting, via experiment, that children do not form classificatory concepts in the terms predicted by formal logic. And more recently, racist American anthropologist Vincent Sarich has analogized the concept to race to buttress his pernicious essentialistm. But it is Wittgenstein who made the concept famous--first by resorting to the image of a rope but more famously by discussing the trickiness of defining "games" in Philosophical Investigations. For ten points, name this term for a group of categorical items that share no universal common features and so can only be defined by reference to their overlapping similarities.

answer: The {Sickness Unto Death}

Chapter 2 of this work cites a line from Macbeth, “All is but toys: renown and grace is dead,” to show how the selfish culmination of ambition leaves one grasping at grace, and thus one cannot even enjoy his own achievements. One appendix focuses on the modo ponedo form of an offense, as the affirmation of Christianity as a falsehood confers the same on Christ. Proposing that sin is a ‘position' and not a ‘negation,' this work begins with the elliptical definition of the self as “a relation which relates itself to its own self.” It takes its title from a verse in the Gospel of John and was written under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Concluding that despair is homologous with sin, for ten points, name this “Christian Psychological Exposition” written by Soren Kierkegaard.
