This thinker's development of a non-dialectical path to social organization and liberation stands as a radical exception to bourgeois trajectory of thought according to Antonio Negri's analysis of his thought, The Savage Anomaly. A 1780 public dispute between F.H Jacobi and Gotthold Lessing centered on this man's philosophy. like Hobbes this thinker adopts an amoralist stance regarding “natural right” but unlike Hobbes concludes in one work that democracy and not monarchy is the most natural form of state. In a major work he articulates a substance-monism wherein modes and attributes of that infinite substance give rise to variety and attempted to organize those arguments relating God, substance and humanity in a “Geometrical Manner.” For 10 points, name this author of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and Ethics a Dutch Jewish philosopher.

One of this man's works analyzes the strange language used in response to a request by Aias, Phoenix, and Odysseus in the chapter "Achilles' Passionate Conjecture."  Besides that work subtitled "A Tale of Abstraction Versus the Richness of Being", this man inclined to realism under the influence of Herbert Feigl's paper "Existential Hypotheses"  prompting him to argue that positivist theories lead to the "stability thesis", which was inferior to the "Thesis I." This author of The Conquest of Abundance wrote a work featuring a section of invective entitled "Conversations with Illiterates", which responded to critics of an earlier work. That earlier work argued Galileo's theories prevailed because he wrote rhetorically persuasive Italian and contended that Copernicanism only survived because reason was overruled. That work, which was dedicated to Imre Lakatos, also contends that the historical practice of science amounts to "anything goes", arguing for a position of "epistemological anarchism." For 10 points, name this author of the autobiography Killing Time, as well as Science in a Free Society and Against Method.

answer: Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad {al}-{Ghazali}

This man claimed that when blind belief "ceases it is shattered like a glass whose fragments can not be again reunited except by being cast again into the furnace and refashioned." He argued against corporeal resurrection by comparing it to the transformation of iron into a garment. He used a fourfold structure of three maqam, one of which is split into two maslak, to present an occasionalist defense of the possibility of miracles in the seventeenth section of one work; that occasionalist position was tribute to his teacher al-Juwaynii, an Asharite. His most famous work draws on the positions of John Philoponous for its first section, which refutes doctrines of "pre-eternity" and "post-eternity" in the works of al-Farabi and Avicenna.
