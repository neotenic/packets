answer: Of {Grammatology} [accept De la {grammatologie}]

In this work, one concept is used to define both dualism and the Hegelian “Aufhebung” and is criticized for causing a de-emphasis on “presence”.  The author examines the “neume” as part of an analysis of an essay which presents the “simple movement of the finger” to illustrate one idea.  While discussing that essay by Rousseau, the concept of the “voice” is identified with consciousness, which, since it produces the ideal of “being” independently of relations to other objects, is termed “pure auto-affection”.  In addition to discussing the “trace”, this work criticizes the concept of time for establishing the “linear” interpretation of a central concept, a “non-linear” example of which is illustrated by a discussion of Andre Leroi-Gourhan's concept of the “mythogram”.  Both psychoanalysis and structural linguistics are predicted to have the potential to challenge the irreducible conception of “being”, and the signifier and signified are shown to be identical in a discussion of “differance”.  This work also claims that Heidegger and Nietzsche were forced to make use of conventional philosophical systems in order to destroy them from within.  FTP, name this seminal text of deconstruction written by Jacques Derrida.

answer: {Pegasus}

When Mount Helicon grew skyward after the Muses defeated the daughters of Pierus in a singing contest, Poseidon beseeched this figure to use his strength to halt its growth. While this figure helped his most famous companion defeat the Solymi and the Amazons, he was also responsible for that companion's death when he was stung by a gadfly sent by Zeus.

Sometimes considered a son of Poseidon, this brother of Chrysaor was born when Perseus decapitated his mother. After this bearer of Zeus' thunderbolts was tamed by Athena's golden bridle, his companion used this figure's ability to fly to defeat the Chimera.

answer: Immanuel Kant

Besides writing, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces, this philosopher asserts that the laws of nature and the laws of human conduct are compatible precisely because they are both products of human thought in his last work, The Conflict of the Faculties. His work on religion includes an essay ridiculing metaphysical theories as the fantasies of the Swedish Theosophist Emmanuel Swedenborg whom this author calls a “Spirit Seer,” and rejects both the ontological argument and the argument from design in The Only Possible Argument.

answer: The Concept of {Mind}

In one section, this work discusses a soldier who masters the concept of “contour” and is unable to define “contour” but is able to relate how he mastered it to argue that abstract concepts are not learned, and only the way in which the term is used is learned.  This work claims that “specialist theories” can only be philosophically analyzed uniformly via a general vocabulary as part of its author's interpretation of “ordinary language”.  The logical cause and effect relationship between reason and action is expanded under an assumption of physicality into an infinite regression of prior actions, part of an extended criticism of the “type-error” or “category-mistake” which arises from applying perceptual definitions to non-perceptual mental processes.  Describing a certain philosophy as relying on a “ghost in the machine”, for 10 points, name this behaviorist-influenced attack on Cartesian dualism written by Gilbert Ryle.

answer: {Hydriotaphia}, {Urn Burial}

This work claims "Life is a pure flame, and we live by an invisible sun within us." It argues that we cannot "extenuate the valour of ancient martyrs" because they "parted with life when it was scarce worth living" and that "to subsist in lasting Monuments" was part of the Christian Elysium, but that "all this is nothing in the Metaphysicks of true belief." The "iniquity of oblivion" is illustrated by the fact "Herostratus lives that burnt the temple of Diana; he is almost lost that built it." It claims "what song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed" are puzzling, though not beyond conjecture. This work's sequel espouses a "higher geometry of nature" via the quincunx, the figure x, and the lozenge shape; that sequel is The Garden of Cyrus. Exemplifying Baroque prose in lines like "man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes, pompous in the grave", for 10 points, name this work of Thomas Browne inspired by the discovery of a Bronze Age funerary site.

In one chapter of this work entitled “Of Perogrative” the author notes that strict observance of the law may do harm, using the example of pulling down an innocent man's burning house. It contends that a man cannot enslave himself because he does not have "the power of his own life", a position possibly at odds with the one espoused in the author's work on The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina. One section of this work represents a very detailed critique of a work which advocates for the divine right of kings, Robert Filmer's Patriarcha. The first section of this work features various sections discussing "Adam's Title to Sovreignty", while unlike Hobbes the author distinguishes between the “state of nature” and the “state of war.” Often published along with A Letter Concerning Toleration, for 10 points, name this work of political philosophy by John Locke.

This work compares being "in a slough of foul and filthy lusts" to being "kept down by the lusts of an unclean swine" in showing that unrighteousness degrades humanity. A Latin pun along the lines of "The sole power which can see all is justly to be called the solar" is used to illustrate the power of God in a section that ends asking "Why do ye sluggards turn your backs? When the earth is overcome, the stars are yours." One figure claims the siren Fortune has "preserved her own constancy by her very change." It opens with the title figure angrily asking "Who has suffered these seducing mummers to approach this sick man?" when she sees the Muse of poetry encouraging the narrator to write gloomy songs. The narrator bewails how he saved Paulinus and Albinus and opened himself to the persecutions of Conigastus and Trigulla, favorites of Theodoric.

This work's author sarcastically claims that people of his day are so potent and enflamed that they conceive as easily as a partridge hen hearing the voice of a cock, which prefaces his discussion of "concealment" and "recognition" as part of drama. It quotes Gloucester's "I, then, am rudely stamped" as exemplifying the formation of the demoniacal from the inability to endure pity. It repeatedly mocks the poet's necessary recourse to sympathy, including while discussing the heroism of a figure from Aristotle's Poetics who heeds the oracle at Delphi. This work's epilogue cites spice traders who threw cargo into the sea to raise prices and wonders if an analogous delusion is what the present generation needs. It ends speaking of a disciple of Heraclitus who wished "only to go further." One section concludes that either "faith never existed, because it has always existed" or " the individual as the individual is higher than the universal", exemplifying one of the central paradoxes. Another section concludes that there is a telelogical suspension of the ethical. For 10 points, name this work which asks three questions regarding Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac, a work of Soren Kierkegaard.
