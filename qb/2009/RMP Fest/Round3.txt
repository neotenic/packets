answer: Jeremy {Bentham}

W. V. O. Quine's essay “Epistemology Naturalized” contrasts Hume's language theories with those of this philosopher, who emphasized the importance of paraphrasis, or contextual definition, and translating whole sentences containing abstract terms to show the meaning of the terms without identifying corresponding objects.  In addition to that “theory of fictions”, this philosopher distinguished between positive and negative acts and attacked theories of natural rights for relying on normative principles.  His first book addressed Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and another work by this philosopher contrasts social and hedonic calculations of the aggregate and individual forms of a quantity central to his “greatest happiness principle”.  FTP, name this philosopher who wrote A Fragment on Government and An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, the founder of utilitarianism.

In this work, the author twice criticizes the article on Rorarius in his rival's Dictionary for disputing his ideas, and the term appetition is used to label an internal principle causing perceptions to change.  The example of dogs fleeing when threatened with sticks is used to illustrate the definition of the soul as possessing both perception and memory, and the author criticizes the lack of a distinction between prolonged unconsciousness and absolute death in Cartesian philosophy.  The existence of God is proven a priori as a necessary truth dependent on contradiction and a posteriori as a contingent truth dependent on sufficient reason.  This work concludes by discussing the pre-existing harmony between efficient and final causes and theorizing that our world is the best of all possible worlds.  Expounding the theory that all compound substances are composed of the namesake simple ones, FTP, name this treatise by Gottfried Leibniz.

answer: {Three Dialogues} Between {Hylas} and {Philonous}

In one section, this work questions the idea behind the concept of being “spread” and asks whether an object can be spread without being extended as part of an argument against the theory of a “substratum”.  In another section, an example involving an insect's foot is used to criticize the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of objects, and that section concludes with the affirmation of materialism's inevitable degeneration into skepticism.  This work criticizes the equation of “real existence” with “mind-independent existence” and argues for the existence of our ideas in the mind of an infinite perceiver called God and builds on the theory set forth in the author's earlier Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge that reality is determined by our own perception.   FTP, name this work consisting of philosophical debates between characters representing John Locke and the author, George Berkeley.

answer: {Multiple Realizability}

The fact that jade fragments into jadeite and nephrite, thus failing the nomicness test of projectibility is one objection to this philosophical position articulated by Jaegwon Kim, and Kim also argued that this theory forces recourse to "structure specific bridge laws" and "local reductions." One philosopher formulated this theory as a response to Ernest Nagel's "intertheoretic account", and that philosopher also used this theory to show that physicalist type identity theories are not sufficiently abstract, unlike functionalist ones. Besides Jerry Fodor, another supporter of this position used the existence of pain in a wide variety of species to show that the correspondence between mental and neural kinds posited by "brain state theory" was untenable. Developed by Hilary Putnam, for ten points, name this philosophical position arguing that a psychological kind can correspond to many possible physical kinds.

Massimo dell'Utri's article "Choosing Conceptions of Realism" is an analysis of this concept. This concept's formulation posits a man who "has been told he understands Japanese", as well as a picture of a tree accidentally dropped by a spaceship. This concept is introduced in a chapter which begins by considering an ant tracing curves in sand such that it produces a recognizable caricature of Winston Churchill, leading into a discussion of magical theories of reference. This thought experiment compares its namesake entities with Turing machines playing the imitation game and is refuted on the basis of semantic externalism. Introduced in Reason, Truth, and History, for 10 points, name this thought experiment of Hilary Putnam, which postulates an evil scientist who connects nerve endings to a computer to produce an illusion of the real world.

answer: The {Gay Science} [or {Die Frolische Wissenschaft}]

In a section directed to the realists in Book Two of this work, the author mocks their supposed project by referencing a Schiller ballad about a boy who entered a temple in the city of Sais who secretly lifted the veil of Isis. This work warns of the danger of Amor fati and warns against the seduction of the belief in personal providence in a section dedicated to St. Januarius. The author claimed that this was the “most personal of all my works,” containing a “Prelude in Rhymes” titled “Joke, Cunning and Revenge” and an appendix consisting of songs of Prince Freebird. Suggesting that just like the shadow of Buddha was shown in caves after his passing; we too cannot overcome the shadow of God and its title derives from a Provencal expression regarding the skill of a troubadour. For ten points, name this work by Friedrich Nietzsche that introduced the aphorism “God is dead” and whose title suggests a happy school subject.
