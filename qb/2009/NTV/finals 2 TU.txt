answer: {Huntington's} disease [or {Huntington's} chorea]

Tetrabenazine was recently approved to treat this disease, functioning by inhibiting VMAT-2. While this disease's mechanism is not fully understood, it is known to result in nuclear inclusion bodies, which may explain the toxicity caused by its characteristic protein misfolding. On a larger scale, it damages the striatum in the brain, likely responsible for its symptoms of chorea. Marked by a long CAG repeat on chromosome 4 resulting in a mutant namesake protein, identify this neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disease whose onset comes around age 40.

answer: {hybridization} [accept word forms; accept {hybridized orbitals}, etc.]

As developed by the LCAO procedure, this phenomenon arises because the Schrödinger equation is linear, so linear combinations of solutions to it are also valid solutions. One model predicts that hydrogen sulfide would exhibit this phenomenon, but it is not observed because the bonds lengths are high, decreasing electron-electron repulsions. It applies to the central atoms of methane, ammonia, and water, and was proposed by Linus Pauling. Name this phenomenon from VSEPR (ves-pur) theory in which two atomic orbitals mix to create new ones, such as the sp orbital.

answer: color charge

If not for this property's introduction, omega-minus baryons would violate the Pauli exclusion principle. This property actually increases with distance from the particles that possess it. It changes when a quark gives off a gluon, and combines with its anti- variety to form mesons. Particles with this property cannot be isolated, its namesake confinement. This quantity can have three values, which can combine neutrally to form a baryon, while particles without this property are known as leptons and are not subject to the strong nuclear force. Name this property possessed by gluons and quarks, studied in quantum chromodynamics.

answer: {Miller}-{Urey} experiment [or {Urey}-{Miller} experiment]

Devised to test Alexander Oparin's 1924 hypothesis, experiments similar to this one were performed by Wilde and MacNevin. A purely aqueous variation used hydrogen cyanide to produce adenine, and was performed by Joan Oró. A 2008 reanalysis of the solutions in this experiment found that the “volcanic” version of the experiment produced far more compounds than previously realized—not five, but twenty-two amino acids. Using an electrical spark to simulate lightning and producing organic compounds from hydrogen, ammonia, water, and methane, name this 1952 experiment which demonstrated the feasibility of abiogenesis on an early Earth.

answer: law of {large numbers} [accept “{weak}” or “{strong}” as a {modifier}; accept {Bernoulli's Theorem}]

Markov's inequality can be used with Chebyshev's inequality to derive one form of this law, a form that also leads to the asymptotic equipartition property. The other form of this theorem applies if the sum of all variances divided by the index squared converges; that is known as the Kolmogorov criterion, and applies to the strong version of this theorem, which adds that the convergence is almost sure. With a name coined by Simeon Poisson, identify this law that states that as n approaches infinity, the arithmetic mean of n random variables converges to its expected value.
